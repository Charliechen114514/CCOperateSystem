​	CC Operating System is a quite common and simple operating mininum system that can run in virtual machines. To startup, you need to setup your work environment, With current time, I can promised that the repo except my specially markings, all the code is available to use the newest gcc and nasm to compile.

![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/TOOLS-GCC>=4.4.7-brightgreen)![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/TOOLS-nasm>=2.16-red)![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/Environment-Bochs_Only_Current-blue)

​	So, what you need to do is absolutely simple. Above all, we need only 

- `gcc(Promised version is >=4.4.7, up to the newest version)`
- `nasm(Promised with the newest version)`
- `bochs(Promised with 2.8 only(2.8 or less is also ok! but you need to modify the scripts!), see the Documnetations below To seek the modifications)`

​	That all the case! Author has been tested running in WSL, Ubuntu And Arch Linux, so I could provide the instructions of setup for you! See the below tutorials for the details!
