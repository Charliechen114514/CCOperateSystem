# Setups

 Here is the documentation for setting up the environment. As of now, the configuration scheme that I can responsibly give is as follows!

 If you like the WSL series, then you can:

> [Setup in WSL-Ubuntu](WSL-Ubuntu.md)
>
> [Setup in WSL-Arch](WSL-Arch.md)

 If you want to run on your local distributionâ€”â€”

> [Setup in ArchLinux](ArchLinux.md)
>
> [Setup in Ubuntu24.04 or any!](Ubuntu.md)
